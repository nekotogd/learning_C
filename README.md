# What is this?
My Repo of C scripts as I'm learning how to write C. Decided to make public so others might benefit from it.

# Plans

Want to mainly focus on learning C, but I plan on making a bit of documentation for this so that others can learn C or just grab some example code to use for themselves.

I've been fiddling with Jupyter Notebooks lately, I think that might be a good way to create the docs for this.

However I'll only focus on it after I'm done with learning a good chunk on C.

For now this will mostly consist of example code you can look through or use.
